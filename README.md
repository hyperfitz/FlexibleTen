### Alright buddy, I already know how I am going to say this better, but this is the crux of it; a very incomplete

# FlexibleTen
# A calculator for flexible ten mathematics 
The Hypothesis of Flexible Ten Mathematics:

There is great emphasis placed on “the powers of ten” in education and public awareness of mathematics. 
The behavior of this specific quantity is often viewed as having almost magical properties  due to its special 
mathematical behavior, e.g., how easily it multiplies and divides by itself and how much easier that makes math 
when dealing with multiples of the quantity ten. The Flexible Ten Hypothesis states that there is nothing 
special about the quantity defined as ten (the total number of fingers a typical human has) and that the special 
behavior of ten (10) in mathematics is a notational artifact caused by placing the numeral one (1) and the numeral 
zero (0) next to each other, and that any quantity defined as that symbol will behave identically in mathematical 
notation with the only difference being the total magnitude of the resultant calculations.

For example, take two number systems: a system based on ten numerals and a system based on four.

System one: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

System two: 0,1,2,3.

In the first system the quantity commonly defined as ten is depicted with the symbol 10; in the second system the quantity commonly defined as four is depicted with the symbol 10. 

Now lets do some math starting with addition.

System one: 10 + 10 = 20   ===> 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1   + 1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1   = 20
                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10    11  12  13  14  15  16  17 18  19  20

System two: 10 + 10 = 20  ===> 1 1 1 1   +  1   1   1   1   = 20
                               1 2 3 10     11  12  13  20

In system one you can see that 4 + 4 would equal 8, not useful when trying to apply “powers of ten.” In system two you can 
see that depicting the quantity 4 from system one with the symbol 10 has caused it to behave the same way that ten does in 
our current number system.

Now more examples.

Multiplication:

System one: 10 x 10 = 100 ===> We all know this; I won’t bother showing it.

System two: 10 x 2 = 20 ===> 1 1 1 1     |   1   1   1   1   =  20
                             1 2 3 10        11  12  13  20

                     10 x 3 = 30 ===> 1 1 1 1     |   1   1   1   1     |    1   1   1   1  = 30
                                      1 2 3 10        11  12  13  20         21  22  23  30

                     10 x 10 = 100 ==> 1 1 1 1    |   1   1   1   1   |   1   1   1   1   |   1   1   1   1 = 100
                                       1 2 3 10       11  12  13  20      21  22  23  30      31  32  33  100

Division:

Exponents:

[skipping these sections for the moment; but I think you can see that they are going to work.]

I’ll pause for a moment here to point out that the above example is quantitatively identical to 4x2, 4x3, and 4x4 in 
the standard ten digit system, but now rather than being denoted as 8, 12, and 16 (not useful in “powers of ten” notation), 
they are being denoted as 20, 30 and 100 (very useful in “powers of ten” notation). It is also worth noting that the quantity 
defined as 10 in the standard ten digit system is defined as 22 in the four digit system; if you multiply 22x22 in the four 
digit system it is quantitatively identical to multiplying 10x10 in the ten digit system. These things are true because of 
the simple fact that any quantity multiplied by another quantity or itself is going to be a multiple of itself, and multiples 
of the notation “10” are, in effect, defined as the integer it is being multiplied by followed by an additional zero, or 
simply the addition of extra zeros. What quantity is being defined as 10 doesn’t matter for the pure mathematical logic. 
This particular point of logic is, in fact, is nothing new: scientists and engineers have been defining arbitrary quantities 
as integer values for centuries. There are literally thousands of examples but I will use the Astronomical Unit (AU), because 
it is basically arbitrary and is quite an awkward number: 1AU =  92,955,808.4343 miles. (An AU is technically defined in 
kilometers, but I am using the miles conversion for the sake of example because of the number is additionally awkward.) By 
logical extension, defining 92,955,808.4343 miles mathematically as one is also defining 10 as 929,558,084.343 miles. 
Now 929,558,084.343 miles will behave as though it is 10 mathematically:

10au x 10au x 10au = 1000 au^3 =  929,558,084,343.00 miles^3

(((10 x 100au)^3)/1au^2)/2 = 500,000,000 au = 464,779,042,172,000,000,000.00 miles

Accepting all of that, a logical consequence of defining a different number system, such as our four digit system, is that 
sub-increment (“decimal”) values between numbers now have different proportional magnitudes compared to the standard ten
digit system. For example, in our four digit system, the increments between 1 and 2 are 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. In other words,
the increment between digits is split into four equal parts.

Standard system: one quarter = 0.25

Four digit system: one quarter = .1

This immediately makes ratios that are not depictable in the standard system depictable in a flexible ten system. For example, 
take a three digit system: 0,1,2.

Standard system: one third = 0.33333333333333333 – forever

Three digit system: one third = .1
